## Welcome to PGCL

Potosí Geometric Computing Laboratory

**No applications. No credentials. Just curiosity.**

If you want to learn, you belong here.

---

## Today's Journey

**Part 1:** Play with geometry in Blender

**Part 2:** Hit Blender's limits

**Part 3:** Break through with Python code

---

## Let's Start with Blender

**First: Make sure you have Blender installed**

Then we'll:

- See geometry concepts visually
- Understand what's possible in 3D
- Build intuition through interaction

**Let's open it together.**

---

## Blender Demo Time

*[Live demonstration]*

**We'll explore:**

- Geometry Nodes basics
- Subdivision and deformation
- Procedural patterns

**Play around, experiment, break things!**

---

## Blender is Amazing, But...

**What happens when you need to:**

- Process 100 files automatically?
- Reproduce exact results?
- Version control your work?
- Integrate with research pipelines?

**This is where code becomes essential.**

---

## Enter: Python + Geometry Libraries

**Gpytoolbox** - Geometry processing operations

**Polyscope** - 3D visualization

Same operations as Blender, but:

- Scriptable and reproducible
- Version controlled
- Research-ready

---

## Setup Time

**What you need:**

- [Install gpytoolbox & polyscope](https://github.com/odedstein/geometry-processing-research-in-python/tree/main/exercise_00)
- [Download a 3D model](https://github.com/alecjacobson/common-3d-test-models)

**Then we'll load our first mesh together.**

---

## Our First Mesh in Code

```python
import gpytoolbox as gpy
import polyscope as ps

# Load a mesh
v, f = gpy.read_mesh("bunny.obj")

# Visualize it
ps.init()
ps.register_surface_mesh("bunny", v, f)
ps.show()
```

**6 lines. That's all.**

---

## What's Next?

Session 2-3: Mesh fundamentals

Session 4-5: Implicit surfaces - sculpting with math

Session 6+: We'll figure it out together!

---

## For Next Week

**Do:**

- Finish setup if needed
- Load at least one mesh in Python
- Experiment with both Blender and code

**Share on the blog:**

- What made sense?
- What's confusing?
- What do you want to build?

---

## Thank You!

**There's no "wrong" in learning.**

We're all figuring this out together.

See you next week!
