# PGCL Knowledge Base

Collective knowledge repository of the Potosí Geometric Computing Laboratory.

## Our Manifesto

**Knowledge should be truly free.** Programs like MIT's Summer Geometry Initiative claim to be open to everyone but require applications with cover letters, resumes, reference letters, and transcripts limited to undergraduate and graduate students who can prove they deserve access. We reject this gatekeeping entirely.

PGCL has no applications, no cover letters, no credentials to prove. We teach geometric computing from the ground up and welcome anyone working professionals, students, self-taught programmers, curious minds. If you want to learn, you belong here. You don't need to convince anyone you're worthy of education. It's a right, not a privilege.

## What's Inside

- Weekly session code and notes
- Guides, tutorials, and learning resources
- Custom tools and utilities

## Our Mascot

The bunny represents computer graphics tradition. The red star represents our belief that information must be free, code is information, therefore code should be free. Different parts of this repository have different licenses, but our code is always free. We only ask to be acknowledged.
